# üéÆ Classic Tetris - Gameplay Mechanics

This document explains the basic gameplay mechanics of the **classic Tetris** game in simple words.

## üß© Overview

**Tetris** is a tile-matching puzzle game where the player controls falling shapes (called *Tetriminos*) and tries to arrange them to make complete horizontal lines. The more lines you clear, the higher your score. The game ends when the screen fills up and there's no room for new blocks.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay Mechanics

### 1. **Falling Blocks (Tetriminos)**

- The game has 7 unique shapes made up of 4 squares.
- One block (Tetrimino) falls from the top at a time.
- You can move and rotate the block to place it better.

### 2. **Play Area (Grid)**

- The playfield is a vertical grid that‚Äôs 10 squares wide and 20 squares tall.
- Blocks fall into this grid and settle when they hit the bottom or another block.

### 3. **Moving and Rotating Blocks**

- You can:
  - Move blocks **left** or **right**.
  - **Rotate** them clockwise or counterclockwise.
  - Use **soft drop** to make them fall faster.
  - Use **hard drop** to place them instantly at the bottom.

### 4. **Clearing Lines**

- If you fill a horizontal line completely, it disappears.
- You earn points for each line you clear.
- Clearing 4 lines at once with a straight block (I piece) is called a **Tetris**.

### 5. **Game Over**

- The game ends when new blocks can‚Äôt enter from the top because the stack is too high.
